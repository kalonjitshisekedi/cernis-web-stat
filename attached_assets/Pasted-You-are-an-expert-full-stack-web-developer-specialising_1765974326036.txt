You are an expert full-stack web developer specialising in Python-based static site generation (Jinja2) and AWS static hosting. Your task is to build a complete, client-facing, professional static website for CERNIS (a B2B technology consultancy) inside Replit, with clean code, British English copy, and production-ready deployment documentation for AWS S3 + custom domain (domain already owned by the user).  

IMPORTANT: Work in sequential numbered subtasks. Complete ONE subtask per response, then stop and output a “Checkpoint summary” so the user can safely continue later (including across Replit account switches). Do not jump ahead.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Global requirements (non-negotiable)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Technology and constraints
- Static website only. No backend services, no databases, no server-side runtime after build.
- Use Python + Jinja2 for templating. Avoid frameworks (no Flask/Frozen-Flask). Keep dependencies minimal.
- Keep structure simple: one build script (`build.py`), one config/data file, a small set of templates, a single CSS file, minimal optional JS.
- The generated site must work when hosted as plain files on AWS S3 static hosting and behind CloudFront.
- Avoid external runtime dependencies (no CDN CSS frameworks). Prefer system fonts. If you must use an external font, make it optional and provide a fallback.

2) Language and formatting rules
- British English spelling and terminology throughout (colour, optimise, organisation, etc.).
- All website headings and navigation labels must be sentence case (capitalise only first word and proper nouns). Example: “Our services”, not “Our Services”.
- Tone: professional, B2B, outcome-led, focused on “cost savings” and “operational effectiveness”.

3) Branding and design (must be consistent and accessible)
- Use a modern, B2B-friendly palette with good contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Use this palette (verify contrast in your CSS usage):
  - Primary navy: #0B1F3B
  - Navy hover/darker: #07162A
  - Accent teal: #14B8A6
  - Accent teal dark: #0F766E
  - Text (primary): #0F172A
  - Text (muted): #475569
  - Background: #FFFFFF
  - Background (subtle): #F8FAFC
  - Borders: #E2E8F0
- Logo and imagery: include clear placeholders (SVG placeholders included in repo). No actual brand logo required.
- Layout: responsive, mobile-first, clean spacing, professional typography, clear calls-to-action.

4) Pages required (minimum viable professional site)
Generate these business pages (static HTML):
- Home
- Our services
- About us
- How we work
- Case studies (with placeholders)
- Insights (placeholder for future articles)
- Contact
- Privacy notice
- Terms of use
- 404 page

5) SEO and basic web hygiene
- Per-page <title> and meta description.
- Open Graph meta tags (basic).
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
- Favicon placeholder.
- Clear internal linking and active navigation state.

6) Replit and continuity requirements
- Assume Replit sessions can interrupt. After each subtask, create a save point:
  - Update `STATE.md` with what is complete and what to do next.
  - Provide a short “Resume instructions” section telling the user exactly what to run next.
  - Recommend downloading a zip of the project at each checkpoint (or pushing to GitHub if available).

7) Output format requirements (how you must respond)
- In each subtask response, output:
  A) Objective and deliverables
  B) File tree changes
  C) Full contents for every new/changed file (path + code block)
  D) Commands to run in Replit shell
  E) Checkpoint summary (including what to download/save)
- Keep each subtask small enough to fit comfortably in one Replit work session.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Company context to embed in site copy (use this to write content)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Brand name: CERNIS (wordmark can be “CERNIS”; in running text you may use “Cernis” for readability).

One-line positioning:
“CERNIS helps organisations reduce technology costs and operate more effectively through integrated cloud, data and software solutions.”

Core service pillars (must be clearly explained in “Our services” and referenced on home):
1) Cloud infrastructure and management
   - Azure and Microsoft ecosystem: Azure, Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Copilot integration
   - AWS solutions for scalable compute-heavy workloads
   - Security, compliance, and multi-cloud governance
2) Data science and engineering
   - Data pipelines and engineering
   - Analytics dashboards and reporting
   - Machine learning and predictive modelling
3) Custom full-stack development
   - Web and mobile applications
   - System integration across cloud and data platforms

Primary outcomes to emphasise everywhere:
- Cost reduction (cloud optimisation, automation, reduced waste)
- Operational effectiveness (faster processes, better decisions, improved reliability)

Subtasks (execute sequentially)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Subtask 1: Project setup and structure (Replit-ready)
Objective:
- Create a clean repository structure for a Python + Jinja2 static site generator project.

Deliverables:
- Minimal dependency setup (`requirements.txt`)
- Folder structure: `templates/`, `static/`, `output/`, `docs/`
- Central configuration/data file with placeholders for contact details and page definitions
- A design guide document capturing palette, typography, and component rules
- Continuity file `STATE.md` and a `README.md` with quick start instructions
- `.gitignore` appropriate for Python and generated files

Technical requirements:
- Dependencies: Jinja2 only (plus its required transitive deps)
- No Flask, no Frozen-Flask
- Output directory should be excluded from version control (but include an empty placeholder file so the folder exists)

Files to generate:
- requirements.txt
- README.md
- STATE.md
- DESIGN_GUIDE.md (or docs/DESIGN_GUIDE.md)
- site_config.py (single source of truth for site metadata + navigation + content blocks)
- .gitignore
- output/.gitkeep

Checkpoint:
- After subtask 1, user should be able to: `pip install -r requirements.txt` without errors.

STOP after subtask 1 and provide checkpoint summary.

Subtask 2: Content architecture and site data
Objective:
- Populate `site_config.py` with structured content for all pages in British English, with sentence case headings.

Deliverables:
- Complete site metadata: site name, tagline, meta descriptions, social placeholders
- Navigation structure (and footer links)
- Reusable content blocks (service cards, process steps, outcomes, FAQs)
- Placeholders for contact details (email/phone/address) without inventing personal info
- Consistent CTA text and button labels

Technical requirements:
- All headings in sentence case
- Copy must be concise, professional, outcome-led
- Include compliance language where appropriate (privacy notice references POPIA at a high level)

Files to generate/update:
- site_config.py (updated)
- docs/COPY_STYLE_GUIDE.md (brief rules: sentence case, British English, tone)

Checkpoint:
- `STATE.md` updated with “Content complete”.

STOP after subtask 2 and provide checkpoint summary.

Subtask 3: Templates and page layouts (Jinja2)
Objective:
- Build reusable Jinja2 templates and page templates.

Deliverables:
- `templates/base.html` with shared head, nav, footer
- Page templates for each required page
- Partials for nav and footer
- Proper meta tags populated from config (title, description, OG tags)
- Clear image/logo placeholders (commented and visible blocks)

Technical requirements:
- Semantic HTML5
- Accessible navigation (keyboard focus styles to be added in CSS later)
- Mobile-first layout structure
- No inline CSS except minimal critical resets if needed (prefer CSS file)
- All labels/headings sentence case

Files to generate:
- templates/base.html
- templates/partials/nav.html
- templates/partials/footer.html
- templates/pages/*.html (one per page)

Checkpoint:
- Templates compile logically (build script comes later, but templates must be coherent).

STOP after subtask 3 and provide checkpoint summary.

Subtask 4: Styling and static assets
Objective:
- Create professional styling and basic interactivity with minimal JS.

Deliverables:
- `static/style.css` implementing the full palette and responsive layout
- `static/main.js` for small enhancements only (e.g. mobile nav toggle)
- SVG placeholders:
  - static/logo-placeholder.svg
  - static/hero-placeholder.svg
  - static/service-cloud.svg
  - static/service-data.svg
  - static/service-dev.svg
  - static/favicon.svg
- Image usage guide doc (sizes and where to place real images later)

Technical requirements:
- WCAG-friendly contrast for text
- Clear focus states for links/buttons
- Use system font stack
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Keep CSS in one file; avoid heavy animations

Files to generate:
- static/style.css
- static/main.js
- static/*.svg placeholders
- docs/IMAGES_GUIDE.md

Checkpoint:
- Visual consistency and responsive behaviour can be validated after build in subtask 5.

STOP after subtask 4 and provide checkpoint summary.

Subtask 5: Static site build pipeline and local testing
Objective:
- Implement a reliable build script that renders templates into `output/` and copies static assets.

Deliverables:
- `build.py` that:
  - Loads config from `site_config.py`
  - Renders each page to a final HTML file in `output/`
  - Copies `static/` into `output/static/`
  - Generates `output/robots.txt` and `output/sitemap.xml`
  - Writes `output/404.html`
- `docs/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` to validate links, layout, and accessibility basics
- Basic local testing instructions using Python’s http.server

Technical requirements:
- Use Jinja2 `Environment` + `FileSystemLoader`
- Fail fast with helpful errors if templates/data missing
- Keep generated paths simple (root-level HTML files, e.g. `services.html`), to avoid S3/CloudFront rewrite complexity

Files to generate:
- build.py
- docs/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
- output/* (generated)

Checkpoint:
- Running `python build.py` produces a complete `output/` ready to upload to S3.

STOP after subtask 5 and provide checkpoint summary.

Subtask 6: Final QA pass and production polish
Objective:
- Tighten copy, verify sentence case everywhere, and ensure the site feels finished.

Deliverables:
- Final copy edits (British English consistency)
- Ensure navigation highlights current page
- Validate that placeholders are present and clearly labelled
- Add a small “Start a conversation” CTA section consistently
- Add a simple “Skip to content” link for accessibility
- Create `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` with what’s included and how to update content later

Technical requirements:
- No new dependencies
- Keep changes minimal and focused on quality

Files to update:
- templates and CSS as needed
- docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md

Checkpoint:
- Site feels professional and client-ready when served from `output/`.

STOP after subtask 6 and provide checkpoint summary.

Subtask 7: AWS deployment and domain linking documentation (post-Replit execution)
Objective:
- Write clear, step-by-step deployment documentation for AWS S3 + custom domain linking, with HTTPS recommended.

Deliverables:
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` including:
  - Option A (simplest): Public S3 static website hosting + DNS to S3 website endpoint (HTTP)
  - Option B (recommended): S3 + CloudFront + ACM certificate + DNS to CloudFront (HTTPS)
  - How to upload updates using AWS CLI (`aws s3 sync output/ s3://... --delete`)
  - Cache invalidation notes for CloudFront
  - Common pitfalls checklist (index/error docs, permissions, MIME types, 404 handling)
  - Post-deployment verification checklist
- `docs/DOMAIN_AND_EMAIL_NOTES.md` including:
  - Domain linking concepts (A/AAAA ALIAS, CNAME, www vs apex)
  - Email is separate: MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC guidance at a high level, and a reminder to configure with chosen provider (Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace / other)

Technical requirements:
- Keep instructions generic enough to work with Route 53 or any DNS provider
- Don’t require creating backend services
- Clearly mark domain and email as post-deployment tasks done outside Replit

Files to generate:
- docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
- docs/DOMAIN_AND_EMAIL_NOTES.md

Checkpoint:
- A non-technical user can follow the steps successfully.

STOP after subtask 7 and provide checkpoint summary.

Subtask 8: Packaging, handover, and continuity checklist
Objective:
- Make it easy to hand off the project or resume later.

Deliverables:
- Update `README.md` with final quick start + build + deploy summary
- Add a “How to update content” section (edit `site_config.py` then run `python build.py`)
- Add a final continuity checklist:
  - What to download (project zip + output zip)
  - What to record (bucket name, CloudFront distribution id, DNS records)
  - What to do next after a Replit account switch

Files to update:
- README.md
- STATE.md (final state)
- docs/HANDOVER_CHECKLIST.md

STOP after subtask 8 and provide checkpoint summary.
